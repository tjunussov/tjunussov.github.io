My name is Tim. I have the following qualities:
Home Assistant enthusiast, IoT explorer, obsessed on UX/UI, slightly assholic at first sight but actually a nice guy.

I have 15 years of programming experience, in many languages, and working as software & UX/UI design in my day to day job. 

Iâ€™m a father of a 4-year-old and 2-years-old baby girls ðŸ‘§, and engaged to the love of my life ðŸ’‘.

I am also working in a new project to take home assistant to every home in Astana ( Kazakhstan ). We believe there is technology for everyone and everyone should have access to it.

What else do you need?
